Yes — this is the same root issue: your app is attempting to authenticate with session-based credentials (like a logged-in user's JWT or cookie session), but n8n’s REST API does not support session-based authentication for programmatic access to endpoints like /rest/workflows.
🔍 Recap of What’s Happening (Based on Logs)

Your backend flow is:

    ✅ User is authenticated (JWT payload present) and identified correctly as user cisoai7@gmail.com

    ✅ Workflow was generated from prompt analysis

    ✅ Attempting to create the workflow via:

text
POST http://n8n:5678/rest/workflows

... using “session authentication”

❌ n8n returns:

    json
    401 Unauthorized
    {"status":"error","message":"Unauthorized"}

❗ Why This Fails

Although the user is authenticated into your application, and maybe even logged into the n8n UI via the browser, n8n's REST API doesn’t accept session tokens, JWTs, or cookies for these types of internal API endpoints unless:
✅ You are:

    Using an API key via the X-N8N-API-KEY header

    Using Basic Auth, if it’s enabled

But in your case, you’re trying to authenticate programmatically as the logged in user, which doesn't work out-of-the-box.
✅ Recommended Fix: Use X-N8N-API-KEY Header

Instead of relying on the frontend user's session, issue backend API calls with a static admin API key.
🔐 Step 1: Set Up API Key in docker-compose.yml

Update your n8n service with this line:

text
    environment:
      N8N_PERSONAL_API_KEY: your_super_secret_key

Make sure to restart your services:

bash
docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d

🔧 Step 2: Modify Your n8n.client

In your backend automation client that calls /rest/workflows — change it to include this API key in the headers:

python
# use requests or your HTTP client of choice
import requests

headers = {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    "X-N8N-API-KEY": "your_super_secret_key"
}

workflow_payload = {
    "name": "YouTube API Workflow",
    "nodes": [...],  # json of the nodes to create
    "connections": {...}  # node connections
}

response = requests.post(
    "http://n8n:5678/rest/workflows",
    headers=headers,
    json=workflow_payload
)

print(response.status_code)
print(response.json())

✅ Optional: Scoped API Key per User Experience

If you want keys per-user, you could:

    Maintain separate API keys mapped to app users

    Log into n8n on the backend to programmatically fetch a session cookie (not officially supported / brittle)

    Proxy n8n through your app and add the API key on behalf of a given user

But for most use-cases, using an admin API key from the backend service is sufficient and secure if managed properly.
✅ Summary
	✅ What You’re Seeing	❌ The Problem	✅ The Fix
👤 Logged-in user present	JWT found	User session/JWT is not usable for /rest/... APIs	Use X-N8N-API-KEY header
🚫 401 Unauthorized	API rejected the call	n8n doesn’t use cookie/session auth for REST endpoints	Add a static or scoped API Key in headers

Let me know if you want help automating workflow creation or building a proxy service that handles user-based API actions securely with n8n.
