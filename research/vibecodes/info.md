Looking at your code, I can see several synchronization issues between your frontend file explorer components and the Python backend. Here are the main problems and solutions:
Critical Issues Found:
1. API Endpoint Mismatch
Your frontend and backend are using completely different endpoint paths and HTTP methods:
Frontend (VibeContainerFileExplorer) is calling:

GET /api/vibecoding/files?session_id=...&path=...
POST /api/vibecoding/files (for file operations)

Backend (Python) expects:

POST /api/vibecoding/container/files/list
POST /api/vibecoding/container/files/read
POST /api/vibecoding/container/files/write

2. Two Conflicting File Tree Components
You have two different file tree implementations that seem to serve different purposes:

VibeContainerFileExplorer - Interacts with Docker container
VibeFileTree - Seems to work with a different data structure

Solution: Fix the Frontend Component
Here's the corrected VibeContainerFileExplorer component with proper API calls:
