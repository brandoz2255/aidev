To enable your AI application to remember the context of previous messages within the same chat thread, you need to maintain and utilize the conversation history when building the prompt for each new AI response. Here's how you can accomplish this:

    Store the chat history: Every time a user sends a message and the AI responds, append both the user message and the AI response to a chat log or array. This keeps a sequential history of the dialogue.

    Include relevant history in each AI request: When crafting a new prompt for the AI, send along the most recent N messages from this chat history (often the last 5–10 messages), formatted with role labels (e.g., "user", "assistant"). This provides the model with prior context, making the interaction feel coherent and continuous—even though the AI itself is stateless and does not possess memory between API calls

.

Be aware of token limits: Language models have a maximum context window (measured in tokens; e.g., GPT-4 can handle up to 8,000 tokens or more per request). If your conversation exceeds this window, you should truncate or summarize older messages

    .

Example approach, simplified in pseudocode:

python
# Pseudocode for building context-aware conversation
chat_history = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "Hello!"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Hi, how can I help?"},
    ...
    {"role": "user", "content": "What's the weather today?"}
]

# When user sends a new message:
new_message = {"role": "user", "content": user_input}
chat_history.append(new_message)

# Select last N messages within token limit for context
context_messages = chat_history[-5:] # adjust N as appropriate

# Send context_messages as prompt to the AI model
response = call_ai_model(context_messages)
chat_history.append({"role": "assistant", "content": response})

This "memory trick"—feeding the recent conversation into each new AI request—lets the AI generate responses that reference previous exchanges, giving the appearance of memory within a given chat thread

.

For more advanced context retention, like long-term memory or context summarization (to remember details over many conversations or reduce token usage), you can:

    Periodically summarize older parts of the conversation and inject these summaries into the context as a "system message"

.

Use retrieval and embeddings techniques to fetch semantically relevant older messages as context when a new user input relates to past topics

    .

In summary:

    Maintain and pass chat history with each request to simulate AI memory

.

Trim, summarize, or retrieve history as needed to fit within model limits and keep context relevant

    .

This is how almost all consumer chatbots, including ChatGPT, maintain context-aware conversations
