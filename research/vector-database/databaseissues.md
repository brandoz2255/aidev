You're experiencing a frustrating issue where your code/module fails to connect to your vector database (likely PostgreSQL with pgvector) despite being able to connect successfully using a manual script—and both are running inside the same Docker network. Instead, your module falls back to a backup (which is empty) and reports "nothing in here," even though you can verify the database contains data.
Diagnosing the Issue

This kind of problem is common in Dockerized environments and often related to one or more of the following:
1. Database Hostname Resolution in Docker

    If multiple containers (your Python/n8n app and the Postgres database) are on the same custom Docker network, you should use the service name (as given to the Postgres container in docker-compose.yml or your run command) as the host for the DB connection—not localhost, not an IP unless it's static and in-network.

    For example, if your DB service in Docker Compose is called pgsql-db, use host=pgsql-db in your connection string

    .

2. Database Credentials and Database URL

    Double-check that the environment variables (POSTGRES_USER, POSTGRES_PASSWORD, POSTGRES_DB, etc.) passed to your database and the values used by your app module match exactly

.

Be sure there’s no typo (“pguser” vs “postgres”, “database” vs your container name, case sensitivity, etc.)

    .

3. Port & Network Exposure

    From one container to another, you do not need to rely on exposed (published) ports—internal networking suffices if both are on the same Docker network.

    The code should use the internal port (usually 5432), not the host-mapped (external) port if running in Docker together.

4. Dependency Installation and Environment

    Make sure psycopg2 is installed in the environment where your module runs

.

The fallback logic you pasted is designed to use a backup if imports/connection fail—it may be logging why, but only at the WARNING or ERROR level.

If the module logs say “embedding directory not found” or “connection error,” the connection may not even be attempted to the correct host/address

    .

Troubleshooting Checklist

    Check DB URL:

        Confirm that the database_url used by the module is correct (including username, password, host, dbname, and port).

        Example:

    text
    postgresql://pguser:pgpassword@pgsql-db:5432/database

    (If pgsql-db is your Compose/db service.)

Validate Docker Network:

    Ensure both containers are running on the same custom Docker network (not bridge).

    In Compose, using the default network ensures DNS resolution by service name.

Test Connectivity from App Container:

    docker exec -it your-app-container bash

    apt update && apt install -y postgresql-client

    Try: psql -h pgsql-db -U pguser -d database

        If it succeeds, networking is fine; if not, adjust Docker Compose or network settings.

Check Container Logs:

    Ensure your module logs the exact error from psycopg2 when it fails—look for any OperationalError or address resolution errors.

Remove Fallback Temporarily:

    Temporarily modify your code to raise exceptions instead of silently failing/falling back, so you get the root error.

Avoid Localhost for Container-to-Container:

    Never use localhost or 127.0.0.1 in the DB connection string when your code is inside a container trying to reach another DB container

        .

Likely Causes for Your Specific Module’s Failure

    Incorrect Host Configuration:
    The database_url variable inside your module may be referencing localhost or a host not accessible from the container, while your manual script might be using the correct service name or IP.

    Environment Variables vs. Hardcoded Config:
    Your test script and your module may be pulling database config from different places (environment vs. code).

    Module Pathing Issues:
    If fallback code is executing, the main embedding integration/import failed, which could cause the service to default to an empty/in-memory DB or skip loading actual data.

    Silent Error Swallowing:
    Your module’s fallback logic suppresses certain failures, causing it to “pretend” all is fine in fallback but not actually display the real connection error

    .

How to Fix

    Double-check the connection settings in your n8n or app module, ensure host matches your Docker Compose service name.

    Run an in-container connectivity test to confirm host/port/access.

    Examine all log output for errors at startup—enable more verbose/debug logging if available.

    Make sure the environment variables are actually being passed into the container running the app.

    If you continue seeing fallback selection, intentionally break the fallback (comment it out or make it raise) to get the real error.

If you provide your current Docker Compose DB definition, environment variables for your app, and the connection string (with secrets omitted), more targeted help can be provided. The core of your problem is almost certainly a mismatch between how your manual test connects and how your in-container Python code attempts to connect—usually the host value or service name

.

Summary:
Your Docker app/module is not connecting to the intended vector DB due to likely configuration, network, or import pathing issues, causing fallback to an empty backup. Check that your database_url points to the correct Docker service name, that both containers share the same network, and that environment variables are set identically. Mismatched host or a silent import error are the most common causes in your scenario
