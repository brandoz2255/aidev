How to Display Only the Final Answer in Main Chat, and Show Reasoning in AI Insights

To ensure that only the final answer from a reasoning model appears in your main chat bubble (and is read by Chatterbox), while the reasoning/thinking process is shown solely in the AI Insights section, you need to process the model's output in the backend and adjust your frontend logic accordingly.
Backend (Python) Solution

    Separate Thinking from Final Output
    On your Python backend, implement a helper function that extracts reasoning content (usually between <think>...</think> tags or as a separate field in modern APIs) from the main answer. For example:

python
def separate_thinking_from_final_output(text: str):
    thoughts = ""
    while "<think>" in text and "</think>" in text:
        start = text.find("<think>")
        end = text.find("</think>")
        thoughts += text[start + len("<think>"):end].strip() + "\n\n"
        text = text[:start] + text[end + len("</think>"):]
    return thoughts.strip(), text.strip()

    reasoning/thoughts: Content between <think> tags (the model's thought process)

    final_answer: The remaining content (to be shown in the main chat)

Structure Your API Response
After using this function, your backend API should return a response such as:

    json
    {
      "final_answer": "Here is the answer.",
      "reasoning": "This is the thinking process."
    }

Frontend (TypeScript React) Solution

    Display Only Final Answer in Chat

        In your main chat interface component (e.g., UnifiedChatInterface.tsx), ensure you render only the final_answer field in the main chat bubble.

        Do not display the reasoning content here.

    Show Reasoning in AI Insights

        Pass the extracted reasoning content to your AI Insights section component.

        Render this separately, possibly in an expandable or contextual panel for users who want to understand the model's thought process.

    Component Sketch Example

    tsx
    // Main Chat Bubble
    <ChatBubble message={apiResponse.final_answer} />

    // AI Insights Panel
    <AIInsights reasoning={apiResponse.reasoning} />

    Chatterbox (or TTS) Adjustments

        Ensure that your text-to-speech or Chatterbox integration reads only the final_answer field, not the reasoning.

        This prevents it from voicing out the thought process unless explicitly instructed.

Notes on Reasoning Model APIs

    Many modern reasoning models (like vLLM or OpenAI's o-series) already provide a separate field for the reasoning content (sometimes called reasoning_content or similar). If so, you can skip manual parsing and use the response fields directly

Summary Table
Area	What to Show	How to Extract
Main Chat Bubble	Only final_answer	Remove <think>...</think> tags or use content field
AI Insights	Reasoning/think process	Use extracted reasoning or reasoning_content field
Chatterbox/TTS	Only final_answer	Pass only the finalized answer for reading

By splitting the reasoning and answer on the backend and presenting them in separate UI areas on the frontend, you ensure a clean user experience and prevent the reasoning process from being read aloud in the main conversation flow
