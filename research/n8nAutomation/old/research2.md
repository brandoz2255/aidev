Since you are already running n8n self-hosted in a Docker container within your app’s Docker network, you can seamlessly add automation—where your AI chatbot creates n8n workflows programmatically—by integrating your chatbot backend with n8n’s API and Docker setup. Here is a step-by-step, concise pathway tailored for your scenario:

1. Ensure n8n Is Accessible Within Your Docker Network

    Your n8n container should expose port 5678 to your other containers (you typically do this in your docker-compose.yml with ports: - "5678:5678").

    Make sure the chatbot backend can reach the n8n container via the Docker service name or network alias

    .

2. Enable Authentication for Security

    Enable basic auth (strongly recommended for APIs) by adding these environment variables in your n8n container config:

        N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true

        N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=yourUser

        N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=yourPassword

    This prevents unauthorized access to your automation APIs

    .

3. Leverage the n8n REST API

    The n8n REST API lets you create, read, update, and delete workflows programmatically.

    From your chatbot backend, send workflow definitions (JSON payloads) to n8n’s /workflows endpoint using authenticated HTTP requests. Example endpoint (if within Docker network):

    text
    POST http://n8n:5678/rest/workflows
    Authorization: Basic <base64(user:password)>
    Content-Type: application/json

    The JSON body should describe the workflow structure, nodes, and connections.

4. Connect Your Chatbot Backend

    When a user instructs your AI chatbot to “create a workflow,” have your backend generate the corresponding workflow JSON based on user intent.

    The backend should then POST this JSON to n8n’s API as detailed above. Your chatbot acts as a UI for dynamic workflow authoring.

5. (Optional) Expose and Secure n8n Externally

    If you want users outside your Docker network to access n8n, set up a reverse proxy (e.g., Nginx), enable HTTPS, and restrict allowed origins. Always use authentication

    .

6. Persist Data

    Ensure you mount a persistent Docker volume to /home/node/.n8n in your container config so that your workflows and credentials survive container restarts

    .

Docker Compose Example for n8n with Network Integration:

text
services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n:latest
    ports:
      - "5678:5678"
    environment:
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=yourUser
      - N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=yourPassword
    volumes:
      - ./n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n
    networks:
      - your-docker-network

  chatbot-backend:
    build: ./chatbot
    networks:
      - your-docker-network

networks:
  your-docker-network:
    external: true

    Replace your-docker-network with the name of your existing Docker network for your app containers.

    The chatbot backend can now address n8n as http://n8n:5678.

This setup will let your AI chatbot create and manage workflows programmatically on your self-hosted n8n instance, fully automated and contained within your app’s Docker network
