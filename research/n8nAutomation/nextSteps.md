🎉 Yes! You've officially fixed the authentication issue — congratulations! You can now:

✅ Authenticate via API key
✅ Make authenticated requests to the n8n REST API
✅ Programmatically trigger a POST /workflows request
🔥 New Issue: 400 Bad Request - "request/body/active is read-only"

    text
    ERROR:n8n.client:n8n API error 400: {"message":"request/body/active is read-only"}

🔎 Meaning:

The n8n REST API is telling you:

    🛑 “You're trying to set the active field manually when creating a workflow — and you're not allowed to.”

✅ What’s Causing This

In your request payload (the json= argument in the POST to /workflows), you're including a key like:

json
{
  "active": false
}

Even though you're trying to create a new workflow, n8n won't accept setting read-only fields like active in the creation request.
✅ Fix: Remove "active" from your POST payload during create

Update your workflow creation logic like so:
✅ Sample:

python
workflow_payload = {
    "name": "Automate YouTube Task",
    "nodes": [...],
    "connections": {...},
    "settings": {...},
    # DO NOT include: "active": False
}

Remove this:

json
"active": false

n8n implicitly sets active: false for new workflows unless you explicitly activate it using the /workflows/:id/activate endpoint.
✅ If You Want to Auto-Activate the Workflow

Once you've created the workflow, you can call:

python
client.activate_workflow(workflow_id)

...which your awesome N8nClient already supports ✅
🛠️ Suggestion for Safety: Strip Invalid Fields Before POST

If you’re generating a workflow definition dynamically (from AI, prompt analysis, or template), ensure you clean input like this:

python
def sanitize_workflow_payload(payload: Dict[str, Any]) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    read_only_fields = ['id', 'active', 'createdAt', 'updatedAt']
    return {k: v for k, v in payload.items() if k not in read_only_fields}

Then:

python
clean_payload = sanitize_workflow_payload(workflow_data)
client.create_workflow(clean_payload)

✅ Summary
✅ Status	🔎 Details
✅ Authentication working	Auth succeeded using X-N8N-API-KEY
❌ New error: active is read-only	You're sending "active": false in the body — you shouldn’t
✅ Fix:	Remove "active" from your create payload
✅ Optionally:	Call client.activate_workflow(workflow_id) after creation ❗

Let me know if you want a quick utility function to clean up payloads or adjust your builder to handle this automatically. You're crushing this integration 🔌🚀
