"POST /api/chat-history/sessions HTTP/1.0" 422 Unprocessable Entity

What the 422 Unprocessable Entity Error Means

    The server received and understood your API request, but could not process it.

    The syntax of your request is correct and the content type is recognized, so it's not a 400 or 415 error.

    The problem is with the semantic content of the request—there is likely something wrong with the data you are sending, such as:

        Missing required fields.

        A field with an invalid value or data type.

        A logical/business rule violation (like trying to use an email that already exists).

    The request will continue to fail until the specific data issue is corrected

    .

Common Causes for 422 in APIs

    Required fields are missing (e.g., sending data without all necessary attributes).

    Invalid data types (e.g., sending a string when an integer is expected).

    Data validation failure (e.g., an 'email' field that isn’t a valid email address).

    Resource conflict (e.g., updating or creating a record with duplicate unique values).

    Payload structure does not match the API's expectations (e.g., the API expects a dictionary, but receives a list)

    .

Troubleshooting Tips

    Check the API documentation: Ensure your request body matches the definition in the docs.

    Review and log the exact JSON/request payload being sent to see if anything is missing or incorrectly formatted.

    Check server-side validation messages: API responses for 422 errors often contain a JSON message detailing the specific field or issue that failed validation—log or inspect that message if possible.

    Frontend validation: Add or improve validation logic on the client side to catch bad data before making the request

    .

Example Scenario

If your endpoint /api/chat-history/sessions expects a POST body like:

json
{
  "userId": 2,
  "sessionName": "Support Chat"
}

But you send:

json
{
  "id": 2
}

You'd get a 422 error for missing sessionName.
Summary Table
Line in Log	What Happened	Meaning/Issue
User found with ID and info	User lookup succeeded	No problem here
POST /api/chat-history/sessions ... 422 Unprocessable	Attempt to create chat session failed	Data in POST request didn't meet the API requirements
GET /api/ollama-models ... 200 OK	Fetching models succeeded	No problem here

Action: Carefully check the structure and content of the data you’re sending in your POST request to /api/chat-history/sessions. Make sure all required fields are present and have valid values. If you have access to the server’s API error response, it should clarify what field or element is wrong
