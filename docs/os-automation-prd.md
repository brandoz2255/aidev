# OS Automation Extension - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Overview
The OS Automation Extension is designed to enable voice-activated system operations through a chatbot interface, allowing users to execute various commands and automate tasks on their operating system.

## 2. Stakeholders
- **Product Owner**: [Your Name]
- **Developers**: Cline (AI Assistant)
- **Users**: PopOS! users who want voice-controlled OS automation

## 3. Objectives
1. Enable basic OS operations via voice commands
2. Create a modular architecture for easy extension
3. Ensure security and stability of system commands

## 4. Scope
### In Scope:
- Opening terminal windows
- Executing shell commands
- File and directory operations (create, delete, move)
- Application launching
- System status checks (battery, network)

### Out of Scope:
- Complex automation workflows (for future phases)
- Advanced permissions management

## 5. Functional Requirements

### 5.1 Command Recognition
- Chatbot must recognize OS operation commands from voice or text input
- Commands should be processed and executed securely

### 5.2 Terminal Operations
- Open a terminal window on PopOS!
- Execute shell commands in the terminal
- Handle command output and errors appropriately

### 5.3 File/Directory Management
- Create, delete, move files and directories
- List directory contents

### 5.4 Application Launching
- Launch installed applications from voice/text commands

### 5.5 System Status
- Retrieve and report system information (battery status, network)

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Security
- Validate all user inputs to prevent command injection
- Implement proper error handling for failed operations

### 6.2 Performance
- Commands should execute with minimal latency
- System resources should be used efficiently

### 6.3 Usability
- Command structure should be intuitive and easy to learn
- Provide feedback for successful/unsuccessful operations

## 7. Technical Design

### 7.1 Architecture
- Main chatbot interface in `new-chatbot.py`
- OS operation functions in `os-ops.py`
- Integration of voice recognition and command execution

### 7.2 Command Patterns
Define regex patterns for common commands:
- "open terminal"
- "execute [command]"
- "list files in [directory]"
- etc.

## 8. Testing Plan
1. Unit tests for individual OS operations
2. Integration tests for full voice-to-execution pipeline
3. User acceptance testing with real-world scenarios

## 9. Future Enhancements
- Advanced automation workflows
- Support for more complex commands and conditions
- Cross-platform compatibility beyond PopOS!

## 10. Dependencies
- Python packages: subprocess, os, glob, psutil
- System-level permissions for executing terminal operations
