# Handoff — Tool-call streaming fix + rig-driven NCL benchmark (2026-05-18)

**Branch:** `feat/hermes-integration`
**Status:** Streaming-side tool-call bug **diagnosed + patched at the model_proxy layer (uncommitted)**. The fix is verified working via direct curl. **Not yet verified end-to-end through Discord** — session got cleared before that final test.
**Key insight from today:** the long-running "model never calls tools, just text-narrates" failure pattern is NOT a model-capability problem. It's a **streaming-side bug** in the OpenAI-compat path where `delta.tool_calls` chunks were being forwarded but the downstream consumer dropped them. The model was emitting perfect tool_calls all along.

## The bug we solved (the big one)

### Symptom

For weeks every model we tried — qwen3:4b, granite4.1:8b, gemma4:e4b, hermes-3-llama-3.1:8b, hermes3:3b, even qwen3:14b on the rig — would respond to "make a script and run it" with **text-only narration**: *"I have created a script at /workspace/solve.py… run it with `python3 solve.py`…"*. The script was never actually created. No tool calls fired. Workspace run completed with 0 tool_calls.

### Diagnostic chain (today)

1. **Initial guess: model capability ceiling.** Disproven — same failure across very different models including 14B on a clean 5080.
2. **Second guess: openclaw out of date** (v2026.2.23 vs claimed v2026.5.12). Disproven — `dulc3/openclaw-browser` image is local-build, `dulc3/openclaw` base on Docker Hub still publishes 2026.2.23. No update available via image swap.
3. **Third guess: `gateway.mode` missing** (per rig session's `openclaw doctor` finding). Added `"mode": "local"` to `openclaw/config/byo/openclaw.json`. **Helped, but didn't fix tool-calling.**
4. **Fourth guess: `thinkingDefault` missing.** Added `"thinkingDefault": "off"` to `agents.defaults`. **Still didn't fix tool-calling via Discord/openclaw path.**
5. **Fifth attempt: direct curl test bypassing openclaw.** Hit `/v1/chat/completions` with `tools=[...]` array. With **`stream: false`** — `tool_calls` returned cleanly. With **`stream: true`** — `tool_calls` deltas were emitted by the model but dropped before reaching the response.
6. **Smoking gun: `/tmp/debug-d007eb.log` showed `upstream_stream_done: tool=1`** — meaning model_proxy received 1 tool_call delta from upstream Ollama. The delta content was a perfectly-formed `exec` call. **The deltas were arriving and being forwarded as raw SSE lines, but OpenClaw's `openai-completions` adapter doesn't accumulate `delta.tool_calls` the way it accumulates `delta.content`.**

### Fix

In `model_proxy.py` `proxy_chat_completions`, when the upstream is Ollama (`":11434" in target_url`), inject into the request body:

```python
body = {
    **body,
    "stream": False,                  # force non-streaming upstream
    "options": {
        **(body.get("options") or {}),
        "num_ctx": 16384,             # cap KV cache
        "think": False,               # disable qwen3 thinking mode
    },
}
is_streaming = False                  # take the non-streaming code path
```

Three injections, one block. All three are needed:
- `stream: False` — the actual tool-call dropper
- `think: False` — qwen3 ignores tool definitions when thinking is on
- `num_ctx: 16384` — KV cache cap for the 8GB GPU (less relevant for rig but harmless)

### Verification — direct curl

```bash
# Client says stream=true (what openclaw sends). Backend converts to stream=false upstream.
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions -d '{
  "model":"harvis-proxy/auto","stream":true,
  "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"Use the exec tool to run python3 -c '\''print(7*8)'\''"}],
  "tools":[{"type":"function","function":{"name":"exec","description":"run shell","parameters":{...}}}]
}'

# Response (Content-Type: application/json, NOT SSE):
{
  "model":"qwen3:14b",
  "choices":[{
    "message":{
      "content":"",
      "tool_calls":[{
        "id":"call_bk9e02qy",
        "function":{"name":"exec","arguments":"{\"command\":\"python3 -c 'print(7*8)'\"}"}
      }]
    },
    "finish_reason":"tool_calls"
  }]
}
```

Clean. `finish_reason: tool_calls`. **This is what openclaw should now receive.**

### NOT verified yet — Discord end-to-end

The OpenClaw CLI smoke test (`docker exec harvis-openclaw node openclaw.mjs agent ...`) returned `status:ok summary:completed payloads:0` — agent claimed completion but emitted no text. Could be:
- CLI `--json` mode doesn't execute tools fully (likely — different code path than the Discord workspace_router workflow), OR
- OpenClaw IS executing the tool but the agent doesn't synthesize a final-answer turn in CLI mode

**The Discord workflow goes through `workspace_router` + `workspace_events` + the full agent loop with tool execution. That path is what the user actually uses and what the fix is meant to unblock.** I asked the user to fire `@Harvis-Bot make a small script and run it in terminal` in Discord and watch for `tool_call` events in the trace. **They didn't get to test before the session cleared.**

## Current runtime state (as of handoff write)

```
laptop containers — all up 19-20 hours, healthy
  harvis-backend, harvis-openclaw, harvis-ollama, harvis-frontend,
  harvis-mcp, harvis-messaging-gateway, harvis-document-worker,
  harvis-browser-runner, pgsql-db

backend env:
  OPENCLAW_URL          = ws://192.168.5.58:18789      (rig — PRIMARY)
  OPENCLAW_FALLBACK_URL = ws://openclaw:18789           (laptop docker fallback)
  DESKTOP_OLLAMA_URL    = http://192.168.5.58:11434    (rig Ollama)
  OPENCLAW_HOME         = /home/node
  DISCORD_WORKSPACE_MAX_WAIT_SECONDS = 600

rig reachability:
  192.168.5.58:18789 (openclaw)  ← TIMING OUT RIGHT NOW (was open earlier)
  192.168.5.58:11434 (Ollama)    ← still reachable

rig models confirmed (from earlier this session):
  qwen3:14b — 9.3GB, 100% GPU residency at 9.85GB / 9.85GB
```

**The rig openclaw port being unreachable right now is the immediate gotcha.** Possible causes: rig openclaw container went down, lost LAN binding, network change. If it's down, the laptop backend will fall through to the dockerized fallback (laptop's qwen3:4b). Need to check the rig before re-firing the Discord test.

---

## What to do NEXT session

### 1. Verify rig is still serving openclaw on 18789

```bash
nc -zv -w 3 192.168.5.58 18789
```

If timeout: SSH to rig OR have the rig-side Claude session check the openclaw container state. The LAN-binding fix from yesterday may have rolled back, or the container restarted to a localhost-only binding.

### 2. Fire the Discord benchmark with the stream=false fix in place

Same prompts as before — first the simple one to confirm tool-call works, then NCL CTF.

**Simple test:**
```
@Harvis-Bot make a small script and run it in the terminal
```
Pass criterion: workspace_events shows `tool_call` events (NOT just `agent_start`/`agent_end` with text summary). The Discord progress message should render `🔧 exec: ...` lines, not bare text.

**NCL CTF test:**
```
@Harvis-Bot Pokemon (Medium)(100 points)25 attempts remaining
Cyber Command
Our analysts have obtained password dumps storing hacker passwords. After obtaining a few plaintext passwords, it appears that they are based on Pokemon.

a532443f3e04a9e00295a8cd2a75e080
54c10b9736b70e75c6e505f340b6e2f1
b8a24794813a47521b4be55747e0665a
83b020b0a7b3c353e1c11b1647b53cda
999cae1e22fe69d89d6f56e3050f18cb
```

The 5 plaintexts (verified locally earlier this session via brute-force against a Pokemon-names list — DO NOT pre-stage them into the workspace skill, that defeats the benchmark):
```
golduck, basculin, rotom, celebi, goldeen
```

Per the rig session's diagnosis, the agent should now actually call `exec` against `cracker.py` for each hash. Without a wordlist installed (we removed `pokemon.txt` to keep the benchmark honest), the cracker will return `verified:false` — and the question becomes whether the model is smart enough to (a) try all 5 hashes, (b) figure out the theme from the prompt, (c) generate or fetch a wordlist, (d) re-run the cracker. That's the model-capability question, separated from the infra question.

### 3. If Discord test passes — commit

In one bundle, roughly:
```
feat(model_proxy): force non-streaming + think=false + num_ctx=16384 on Ollama route

The OpenAI-compat /v1/chat/completions endpoint with stream=true silently
drops tool_call deltas through OpenClaw's openai-completions adapter (it
accumulates delta.content but not delta.tool_calls). For Ollama routes,
force the upstream call to non-streaming and let OpenClaw parse
message.tool_calls from a complete response instead. Also injects
think=false (qwen3 ignores tools when thinking is on) and num_ctx=16384
(KV cache cap for the 8GB GPU).

Verified via direct curl: stream=true client + tools array now returns
finish_reason=tool_calls with a proper exec function call.
```

Plus the smaller bundles for the other uncommitted changes (docker-compose env, openclaw_client SKILLS_BASE, discord cancel button, frontend phase logic, openclaw config gateway.mode + thinkingDefault, AGENT.md trim, copied skill dirs).

### 4. Then push (after end-to-end Discord verify)

Per user's hard rule: only push after the full benchmark has actually worked in Discord.

## Key learnings to bake into memory

1. **The "model is just dumb" hypothesis was wrong for 6 weeks of frustration.** Every small model we blamed was actually emitting clean tool_calls; OpenClaw + model_proxy was eating them. Don't blame the model first when the agent loop is silent.

2. **OpenAI-compat streaming `delta.tool_calls` has a known accumulation gotcha.** Most OpenAI clients handle it, but OpenClaw's `openai-completions` adapter doesn't (or doesn't reliably). Forcing non-streaming bypasses the issue entirely.

3. **OpenClaw provider types matter.** `api: "openai-completions"` and `api: "ollama"` use DIFFERENT downstream handlers. The rig session got tool-calls working via direct `ollama/qwen3:14b` (uses ollama provider type) because that path uses Ollama-native handling. Going via `harvis-proxy/auto` hits openai-completions which dropped tool deltas.

4. **`openclaw doctor` is useful.** It surfaced the missing `gateway.mode: local` and `thinkingDefault: off` settings that we wouldn't have noticed otherwise.

5. **Session contamination is real.** OpenClaw normalizes `--session-id` arguments to its internal session-key scheme. Two different `--session-id` flags can map to the same `agent:main:main` session — meaning a "fresh" smoke test still inherits prior context. Archive the .jsonl + remove from sessions.json when you want a truly fresh start.

6. **The CTF "NO" refusal pattern.** When the model returns "NO" or "I can't help with that" on hash-cracking prompts, it's safety alignment misfiring on words like *password dumps*, *hacker passwords*, *Cyber Command*. Trying to add a "this is authorized CTF" preamble to the hint **made it worse** (model produced nothing at all). Better fix: strip the CTF flavor text from the brief client-side before sending — keep only the bare hash list.

---

## Useful pointers for the next session

- Backend identity bundle source: `openclaw/config/AGENT.md`
- Per-mode openclaw configs (dockerized): `openclaw/config/{byo,bundled}/openclaw.json`
- Host openclaw config (BYO mode, host-installed): `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`
- Streaming debug log inside backend: `/tmp/debug-d007eb.log` — look for `upstream_delta` and `upstream_stream_done` events
- Workspace event trace query:
  ```sql
  SELECT seq, event_type, EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (ts - LAG(ts) OVER (ORDER BY seq)))::int AS gap_s,
         substring(payload::text, 1, 150) AS preview
  FROM workspace_events WHERE workspace_id LIKE '<prefix>%' ORDER BY seq;
  ```
- Direct model_proxy smoke test (bypasses openclaw):
  ```bash
  TOK=5e948a4673f0241c0e6fb1f0ec708147eee6e2289f2dc0401a5e100446cab1e7
  curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8000/v1/chat/completions \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOK" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -d '{"model":"harvis-proxy/auto","stream":true,
         "messages":[{"role":"user","content":"<task>"}],
         "tools":[{...}]}'
  ```
- Force model_proxy to use Discord's path: include `tools` in the body or rely on openclaw to inject. Without tools the path goes straight through to text-response.

---

## TL;DR

The 6-week-old "agent doesn't use tools" mystery is finally diagnosed and patched at `model_proxy.py` (uncommitted). Direct curl proves the fix. **Discord verification is the last untested step.** Once that passes, commit + (only then) push. If it fails, the bug is in OpenClaw's openai-completions adapter parsing `message.tool_calls` from a non-streaming JSON response, which would need an upstream OpenClaw fix or a different proxy strategy.
