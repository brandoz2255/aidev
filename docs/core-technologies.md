- Context managers for resource management
- Decorators for function modification
- Type hints for better code documentation
- Exception handling and custom exceptions

### Important Libraries
- `asyncio` for asynchronous operations
- `typing` for type annotations
- `logging` for application logging
- `pathlib` for path manipulation
- `re` for regular expressions

### Implementation Details
```python
import gradio as gr

# Create interface
interface = gr.Interface(
    fn=process_audio,
    inputs=gr.Audio(source="microphone"),
    outputs=gr.Audio(),
    live=True
)
```

## Ollama

### Overview
Ollama is a local LLM server that provides access to various language models.

- Error handling

### Implementation
```python
from selenium import webdriver
from selenium.webdriver.firefox.service import Service
from webdriver_manager.firefox import GeckoDriverManager

def init_browser():
    service = Service(GeckoDriverManager().install())
    driver = webdriver.Firefox(service=service)
    return driver
```

## Chatterbox TTS

### Overview
Chatterbox TTS is used for text-to-speech synthesis.

### Key Features
- High-quality voice synthesis
- Real-time processing
- Voice customization
- Audio streaming
- Error handling

### Implementation
```python
from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS

def init_tts():
    model = ChatterboxTTS.from_pretrained()
    return model
```

## Whisper

### Overview
Whisper is used for speech-to-text conversion.

### Key Features
- Accurate transcription
- Multiple language support
- Real-time processing
- Noise handling
- Punctuation and formatting

### Implementation
```python
from transformers import pipeline

def init_stt():
    stt_pipeline = pipeline(
        "automatic-speech-recognition",
        model="openai/whisper-base.en"
    )
    return stt_pipeline
```

## System Requirements

### Hardware
