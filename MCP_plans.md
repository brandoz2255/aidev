MCP Architecture:

MCP Server (your Python tool) ← what you'll build
MCP Client (Ollama/chat interface) ← connects to your tool
Communication happens via JSON messages

Python + MCP Setup:
You'd use the official mcp Python package:


What this MVP provides:
✅ Multi-server support - Switch between local/remote Ollama instances
✅ Dynamic server management - Add new servers without restarting
✅ Model discovery - Automatically list available models per server
✅ Text generation - Basic interface to generate text with any model
✅ Health checks - Test connectivity to your Ollama servers
✅ MCP compliance - Follows proper MCP protocol for tool/resource exposure
Quick Test Flow:

Start Ollama on localhost:11434
Run the MCP server: python ollama_mcp_server.py
Use MCP inspector to test: npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector python ollama_mcp_server.py
Try tools like check_server_status and list_models

What's Next:
Now you can build on this foundation by adding:

Cybersecurity tools (port scanners, hash analyzers, etc.)
Gradio testing interface
Configuration file support
Authentication for remote servers
Logging and monitoring

WE ARENT using gradio we are using the next.js UI frontnend for this  

Core System Tools (Must-haves)

# File & Data Operations
- file_read/write/delete/list
- csv_parse/json_parse/xml_parse  
- image_process (resize, convert, analyze)
- pdf_extract_text/word_extract
- zip_create/extract

# System Information
- get_system_info (CPU, memory, disk)
- list_processes/kill_process
- environment_get/set
- execute_command (with sandboxing!)


Network & Web Tools

# Essential for cybersecurity & automation
- http_request (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE)
- web_scrape (with rate limiting)  
- ping_host/traceroute
- dns_lookup/reverse_lookup
- whois_lookup
- check_ssl_certificate
- port_scan (your cybersecurity focus!)

Communication & Notifications

# For automation workflows  
- send_email/send_slack_message
- webhook_trigger
- sms_send (via Twilio)
- desktop_notification

Configuration & State

# Essential for robust operation
- config_get/set/save/load
- cache_get/set/clear  
- session_create/destroy
- backup_create/restore
- log_write/read (structured logging)

# For programmatic use by other systems
- schedule_task (cron-like)
- trigger_webhook_on_event
- batch_process_files
- workflow_execute (chain multiple tools)
- conditional_execute (if/then logic)
