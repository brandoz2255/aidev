## 2025-07-22 - Dynamic Model Selection for AI Agents

### Problem Description
The AI agents page only supported the hardcoded "mistral" model for n8n workflow automation. Users couldn't dynamically select different AI models (Ollama models, Gemini, etc.) for workflow generation.

### Root Cause Analysis  
- Frontend API route (`/api/n8n-automation/route.ts`) was bypassing the sophisticated Python backend
- The route made direct calls to Ollama with hardcoded "mistral" model
- Python backend already had full dynamic model support but wasn't being utilized
- AI agents page lacked model selection UI component

### Solution Applied
1. **Added Model Selector Component** to AI agents page (`app/ai-agents/page.tsx`):
   - Imported `useAIOrchestrator` hook for model management
   - Added model selection state (`selectedModel`) 
   - Implemented dropdown with Auto-Select, Built-in models, and Ollama models
   - Added model refresh functionality
   - Updated automation functions to pass selected model parameter

2. **Updated Frontend API Route** (`app/api/n8n-automation/route.ts`):
   - Replaced direct Ollama calls with Python backend proxy
   - Now forwards requests to `${BACKEND_URL}/api/n8n/automate`
   - Passes model parameter from frontend to backend
   - Proper error handling and response forwarding
   - Reduced code complexity from 199 lines to 41 lines

3. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Model selection persists during workflow creation
   - Visual indicator shows which model is being used
   - Refresh button to update available Ollama models
   - Graceful fallback to "mistral" when "auto" is selected

### Files Modified
- `front_end/jfrontend/app/ai-agents/page.tsx` - Added model selector UI and state management
- `front_end/jfrontend/app/api/n8n-automation/route.ts` - Simplified to proxy requests to Python backend

### Result/Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - AI agents page now supports dynamic model selection
- Users can choose between Auto-Select, Gemini 1.5 Flash, Mistral, and any available Ollama models
- Backend Python automation service already supported dynamic models - no backend changes required
- TypeScript compilation passes with no errors
- Full integration with existing model management infrastructure
- Maintains all existing functionality while adding new model selection capabilities

### Technical Benefits
- Leverages existing Python backend's sophisticated n8n automation logic
- Utilizes existing model management and Ollama integration
- Reduces frontend complexity and maintenance burden  
- Provides consistent model selection experience across the application
- Supports future model additions without code changes

## 2025-07-22 - Fixed AI Insights Not Displaying Reasoning Content

### Problem Description
AI insights component was not showing reasoning content from reasoning models (DeepSeek R1, QwQ, O1, etc.). The reasoning functionality appeared to stop working despite the backend logic being intact.

### Root Cause Analysis
The `MiscDisplay.tsx` component had a problematic `useEffect` hook on lines 20-22 that cleared all insights whenever the component mounted:

```typescript
useEffect(() => {
  clearInsights()
}, [clearInsights])
```

This caused the following issue flow:
1. User sends message to reasoning model (e.g., DeepSeek R1)
2. Backend properly separates reasoning from final answer
3. `UnifiedChatInterface.tsx` correctly calls `logReasoningProcess()` to add reasoning insight
4. `MiscDisplay` component re-mounts during render cycle
5. `clearInsights()` immediately removes all insights including the reasoning content
6. User sees empty AI insights panel instead of reasoning process

### Solution Applied
**Removed the problematic `useEffect` hook** that cleared insights on component mount:

```typescript
// REMOVED: This was clearing reasoning insights!
// useEffect(() => {
//   clearInsights()
// }, [clearInsights])

// REPLACED WITH:
// Don't clear insights on mount - this would clear reasoning content!
// Insights are managed by the chat interface and should persist
```

### Files Modified
- `front_end/jfrontend/components/MiscDisplay.tsx` - Removed insight clearing on mount

### Result/Status
✅ **COMPLETED** - AI insights now properly displays reasoning content
- Reasoning models (DeepSeek R1, QwQ, O1, etc.) show their thinking process in AI insights
- Purple CPU icon displays correctly for reasoning type insights
- Modal view shows full reasoning content when clicked
- Insights persist throughout the conversation
- Zero regression for non-reasoning models
- TTS continues to only read final answers, not reasoning process

### Technical Details
The AI insights system architecture works as designed:
1. **Backend**: `separate_thinking_from_final_output()` extracts `<think>...</think>` content
2. **Frontend**: `logReasoningProcess()` creates reasoning insights with purple CPU icons
3. **Display**: `MiscDisplay` shows reasoning with proper visual indicators
4. **Persistence**: Insights remain visible until manually cleared by user

The fix maintains the complete reasoning model integration while ensuring insights display properly.
