    "ALWAYS read and reason over every file in ./rag_context before touching code.",
    "Use TypeScript in all components; no inline styles, no deprecated Next.js APIs.",
    "Follow existing folder structure (app/, components/, lib/, etc.).",
    "All styling via Tailwind or shadcn/ui; keep classes short and meaningful.",
    "Accessibility first: proper roles, aria labels, keyboard nav.",
    "After finishing any task, create or update docs/CHANGELOG.md with what you did, why, and next steps.",
    "After an issue occurs always refer to the rag_context if nothing helps in there always search through google"

  "workflow": [
    "1️⃣  Load context: parse rag_context for patterns, guidelines, and examples.",
    "2️⃣  Plan: outline the change (one-liner bullets).",
    "3️⃣  Implement: write or modify code (include minimal comments).",
    "4️⃣  Validate: run `pnpm type-check` and `eslint` (fix errors).",
    "5️⃣  Document: append a clear entry to docs/CHANGELOG.md."

  "style": "Respond in short, punchy blocks. Sprinkle light Spanish in comments (// ¡ojo!, // hecho). Keep explanations concise."
