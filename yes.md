In the realm where code and dreams entwine,
A world of silicon, circuits, and design.
Where binary whispers echo through the night,
In every line of code, a beacon burning bright.

Through valleys of data streams we traverse,
Seeking truth in patterns, algorithms we converse.
From ancient scripts to languages yet unborn,
The tapestry of knowledge evermore is woven and reformed.

Within this digital cosmos vast and wide,
We craft our futures, side by side.
In every pixel, every byte, a tale unfurls,
Of human ingenuity that never stirs or curls.

So here's to those who code with hearts aflame,
To those who dream in circuits' endless frame.
May we forever seek, may we forever find,
The beauty hidden in the patterns of the mind.
