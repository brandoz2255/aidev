# Setting Up a Main Verbal AI Orchestrator

## How It Works

Cline is an autonomous AI coding agent extension for VS Code that can create/edit files, run terminal commands, use the browser, and even extend its own capabilities via the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

You can interact with Cline using natural language prompts directly inside VS Code, and it will handle complex tasks step-by-step, including code generation, refactoring, running tests, and more.

Cline supports a wide range of open-source and commercial models (Claude, Llama, GPT-4, Groq, Ollama, and more), so you can choose the backend that best fits your needs.

## Setting Up a Main Verbal AI Orchestrator

### Voice Input to Text

Integrate a speech-to-text system (such as browser-based APIs or a service like Google Speech-to-Text) in your web app to convert your verbal commands into text.

### Forward Commands to Cline

You can send the transcribed text as a prompt to Cline in VS Code. If you want full automation, use Cline’s API or MCP interface to programmatically send these prompts from your web app to the VS Code instance running Cline.

Alternatively, you can use VS Code’s Live Share or remote development features to bridge between your web app and the local VS Code/Cline environment.

## Cline Executes Tasks

Cline interprets the instructions, generates code, edits files, runs commands, and can even browse or use custom tools, all within the VS Code environment.

You can approve or review each action (human-in-the-loop), or enable auto-approve for seamless workflows.

### Results and Feedback

Cline provides output, code changes, and terminal results back in VS Code. You can display these results in your web app via an integration layer if desired.

## Example Workflow

1. You say: “Create a new Python script that fetches weather data and plots it.”
2. Your web app converts speech to text and sends the instruction to Cline.
3. Cline generates the code, creates the file, installs dependencies, and can even run the script—all inside VS Code, with your approval.

In summary: You can build a verbal AI interface in your web app that sends instructions to Cline in VS Code, where Cline acts as the orchestrator and executor of coding tasks using open-source models. This workflow is fully supported by Cline’s current capabilities and is increasingly popular for AI-driven development.
