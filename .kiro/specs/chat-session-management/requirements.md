# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a robust chat session management system that provides clear separation between different chat conversations. Users can create new chat sessions, switch between existing sessions, and maintain independent conversation contexts without any cross-contamination of messages or context between sessions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user, I want to create a new chat session, so that I can start a fresh conversation without any previous context or messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks the "+ New Chat" button THEN the system SHALL create a new chat session with a unique identifier
2. WHEN a new chat session is created THEN the system SHALL clear all messages from the Main Chat Area
3. WHEN a new chat session is created THEN the system SHALL add the new session to the top of the Sidebar
4. WHEN a new chat session is created THEN the system SHALL highlight the new session in the Sidebar
5. WHEN a new chat session is created THEN the Main Chat Area SHALL be empty and ready for the first message
6. WHEN a new chat session is created THEN the session SHALL NOT contain any messages or context from previous chats

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to switch between existing chat sessions, so that I can continue previous conversations with their full context.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user clicks on a previous chat in the Sidebar THEN the system SHALL load the entire message history of that session into the Main Chat Area
2. WHEN a chat session is selected THEN the system SHALL highlight the selected chat in the Sidebar
3. WHEN a chat session is loaded THEN the Main Chat Area SHALL display ONLY the messages from the selected session
4. WHEN a user sends a new message in a selected session THEN the message SHALL be added to that session only
5. WHEN switching between sessions THEN the system SHALL replace the Main Chat Area content with only the selected session's messages
6. WHEN loading a session THEN the system SHALL maintain the chronological order of all messages in that session

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see all my chat sessions in a sidebar, so that I can easily navigate between different conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application loads THEN the Sidebar SHALL display all existing chat sessions
2. WHEN a new session is created THEN the Sidebar SHALL immediately show the new session at the top
3. WHEN sessions are displayed THEN each session SHALL show a preview or title to help identify the conversation
4. WHEN a session is selected THEN the Sidebar SHALL visually indicate which session is currently active
5. WHEN the Sidebar is displayed THEN sessions SHALL be ordered with the most recent at the top

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want each chat session to maintain its own independent context, so that conversations don't interfere with each other.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new chat session is created THEN it SHALL start with completely blank context
2. WHEN switching between sessions THEN each session SHALL maintain its own conversation history
3. WHEN messages are sent in a session THEN they SHALL only affect that session's context
4. WHEN loading a session THEN the system SHALL NOT mix messages from different sessions
5. WHEN displaying session content THEN the system SHALL ensure no cross-contamination between sessions

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want proper error handling for chat operations, so that I can understand when something goes wrong and the system remains stable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading a chat session fails THEN the system SHALL display "Could not load chat history" in the Main Chat Area
2. WHEN loading a chat session fails THEN the system SHALL keep the Sidebar and other UI elements unchanged
3. WHEN creating a new chat fails THEN the system SHALL display "Could not start new chat" message
4. WHEN creating a new chat fails THEN the system SHALL NOT clear the current chat content
5. WHEN any operation fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the current state and not corrupt existing data
6. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL provide clear feedback to the user about what went wrong

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a user, I want the sidebar and main chat area to always be synchronized, so that I can trust the interface to show the correct information.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a session is selected in the Sidebar THEN the Main Chat Area SHALL immediately reflect that selection
2. WHEN a new message is sent THEN both the Sidebar and Main Chat Area SHALL update to reflect the new message
3. WHEN a new session is created THEN both the Sidebar and Main Chat Area SHALL update simultaneously
4. WHEN the application state changes THEN the Sidebar highlighting SHALL always match the currently active session
5. WHEN switching sessions THEN the transition SHALL be immediate and visually clear to the user
