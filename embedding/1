t's frustrating when a good fix doesn't solve the whole problem. Your implemented code for handling the JSON files looks excellent‚Äîit's more robust than just skipping the files and should have resolved the original 'list' object has no attribute 'get' error.

Since that code is logically sound, the fact that you're still seeing issues points to one of two likely scenarios:

    The original error is gone, but your fix has revealed a new, different error downstream.

    The updated code is not actually running due to a deployment or caching issue.

## Possible Causes

Let's break down what could be happening.

1. A New Data Structure Issue

Your code now correctly extracts a dictionary, which we called workflow_data. However, the code that uses workflow_data might be failing. For example:

    The dictionary might be empty ({}).

    It might be missing an expected key (e.g., there's no "nodes" or "connections" key inside it).

    The value for a key might be the wrong type (e.g., "nodes" is null instead of a list).

2. Deployment or Caching Problem (Very Common)

This happens all the time. You might have updated the Python file, but the running environment is still using the old version.

    Docker: If you're using Docker, did you rebuild the image and restart the container after changing the code? Simply restarting the container might not be enough if the code is copied into the image during the build step.

    Caching: Is there any kind of Python bytecode caching (.pyc files) that might be serving the old version?

## Next Steps: Let's Find the Clue üïµÔ∏è

To figure this out, we need to see the new logs. The error message is the most important clue.

Please provide the latest log output. The full error message and the lines of code it points to (the "traceback") will tell us exactly what's failing now.

Once you share the new logs, we'll know precisely where to look.
