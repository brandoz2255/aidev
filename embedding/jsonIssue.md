course. It looks like you've successfully fixed the database issue, which is great!

The log errors you're seeing now are happening because the Python script is running into the second problem we talked about: the workflow files have an inconsistent JSON structure.

What the Error Means

The error 'list' object has no attribute 'get' confirms that your script is trying to process JSON files that start with a list ([...]) instead of a dictionary ({...}).

Your code expects every file to be a dictionary so it can call data.get("nodes", []). When it gets a list instead, it fails.

The final summary shows that 44 documents were added successfully. This means some of your JSON files have the correct dictionary structure, but the hundreds of errors in the log show that many others have the incorrect list structure.

How to Fix It

You need to add a check in your Python code to handle these malformed files gracefully. This will allow your script to skip the files that start with a list, log a warning, and continue processing the rest without crashing.

Here is a Python snippet you can adapt for your workflow_processor.py. You would place this logic where you open and load each JSON file.
Python

import json
import logging

# Assume 'logger' is configured and you are looping through file paths.
# Inside your loop for each 'file_path':

try:
    with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    # ---> This is the important check <---
    # If the loaded data is not a dictionary, skip it.
    if not isinstance(data, dict):
        logging.warning(f"Skipping file with incorrect format (expected dict, got list): {file_path}")
        continue  # Move to the next file in the loop

    # If the file is a dictionary, your existing code can run.
    nodes = data.get("nodes", [])
    # ... the rest of your processing logic for the file ...

except json.JSONDecodeError:
    logging.error(f"Failed to decode invalid JSON in file: {file_path}")
    continue # Move to the next file
except Exception as e:
    logging.error(f"An unexpected error occurred processing {file_path}: {e}")
    continue # Move to the next file

By adding this type check, your script will become more robust. It will successfully process all the correctly formatted workflows and simply ignore the ones that are causing the error.
