# Embedding Module Integration TODO

## Current Status ‚úÖ
- **Vector Database**: Successfully populated with 700+ n8n workflow embeddings
- **Database Schema**: PostgreSQL with pgvector extension, table `langchain_pg_embedding_n8n_workflows`
- **Embedding Model**: `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384 dimensions)
- **JSON Processing**: Robust handling of diverse n8n workflow formats

## Next Steps: Integration & Utilization

### 1. Database Verification & Analysis üîç

#### Check Current Database State
```sql
-- Connect to your PostgreSQL database
-- Database: postgresql://pguser:pgpassword@pgsql-db:5432/database

-- Verify table exists and check structure
SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name LIKE '%langchain_pg_embedding%';

-- Check total embeddings count
SELECT collection_name, COUNT(*) as total_documents
FROM langchain_pg_embedding_n8n_workflows 
GROUP BY collection_name;

-- Sample the embedded data
SELECT 
    cmetadata->>'filename' as filename,
    cmetadata->>'name' as workflow_name,
    cmetadata->>'source_repo' as source,
    cmetadata->>'node_types' as node_types,
    LENGTH(document) as content_length
FROM langchain_pg_embedding_n8n_workflows 
LIMIT 10;

-- Check embedding dimensions
SELECT 
    array_length(embedding, 1) as embedding_dimension,
    COUNT(*) as count
FROM langchain_pg_embedding_n8n_workflows 
GROUP BY array_length(embedding, 1);
```

#### Analyze Embedded Workflows
```sql
-- Top node types in embedded workflows
SELECT 
    node_type,
    COUNT(*) as usage_count
FROM (
    SELECT jsonb_array_elements_text(cmetadata->'node_types') as node_type
    FROM langchain_pg_embedding_n8n_workflows
) subq
GROUP BY node_type
ORDER BY usage_count DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- Source repository distribution
SELECT 
    cmetadata->>'source_repo' as repo,
    COUNT(*) as workflow_count
FROM langchain_pg_embedding_n8n_workflows
GROUP BY cmetadata->>'source_repo';

-- Average workflow complexity
SELECT 
    AVG((cmetadata->>'node_count')::int) as avg_nodes,
    MIN((cmetadata->>'node_count')::int) as min_nodes,
    MAX((cmetadata->>'node_count')::int) as max_nodes
FROM langchain_pg_embedding_n8n_workflows
WHERE cmetadata->>'node_count' IS NOT NULL;
```

### 2. FastAPI Backend Integration üîå

#### Research Areas

**A. Vector Search API Endpoints**
- **Goal**: Create FastAPI endpoints to query the vector database
- **Key Components**:
  - Similarity search by text query
  - Filtered search by node types, source repo, etc.
  - Hybrid search (vector + metadata filters)
  - Ranked results with similarity scores

**Research Questions**:
- How to integrate LangChain's PGVector with FastAPI routes?
- What's the optimal way to handle embedding queries in the existing `python_back_end/main.py`?
- How to balance search speed vs. accuracy for real-time queries?

**Implementation Approach**:
```python
# Potential FastAPI route structure
@app.post("/api/workflow-search")
async def search_workflows(query: WorkflowSearchRequest):
    # 1. Generate embedding for user query
    # 2. Perform vector similarity search
    # 3. Apply metadata filters
    # 4. Return ranked results with explanations
    pass

@app.get("/api/workflow-stats")
async def get_workflow_stats():
    # Return statistics about embedded workflows
    pass

@app.get("/api/similar-workflows/{workflow_id}")
async def find_similar_workflows(workflow_id: str, limit: int = 5):
    # Find workflows similar to a specific workflow
    pass
```

**B. Embedding Pipeline Integration**
- **Goal**: Allow dynamic embedding updates through API
- **Key Components**:
  - Add new workflows to vector database
  - Update existing workflow embeddings
  - Delete outdated workflows
  - Batch processing for large updates

**Research Questions**:
- How to trigger embedding updates from the main application?
- Should embedding be real-time or batch processed?
- How to handle version control for workflow updates?

#### Database Connection Research
```python
# Current embedding manager connection pattern
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql://pguser:pgpassword@pgsql-db:5432/database"

# Research: How to share this connection with FastAPI?
# Options:
# 1. Direct database connection in FastAPI
# 2. Shared connection pool
# 3. Microservice architecture with embedding service
# 4. Hybrid approach with FastAPI calling embedding module
```

### 3. Frontend Integration Concepts üé®

#### User Interface Research

**A. Search Interface Components**
- **Semantic Search Bar**: "Find workflows for email automation with Slack integration"
- **Filter Panels**: Node types, trigger types, complexity level
- **Result Cards**: Workflow previews with similarity scores
- **Workflow Viewer**: Detailed workflow visualization

**Research Questions**:
- How to present vector search results in an intuitive way?
- What metadata should be shown for each workflow result?
- How to explain similarity scores to users?
- Should we show the reasoning behind search results?

**B. Integration Points in Existing Frontend**
```typescript
// Potential integration locations:
// 1. New "Workflow Library" page
// 2. AI Agents page enhancement
// 3. Chat interface integration
// 4. Workflow creation assistant

// Research: Where does this fit in the current app structure?
// Current structure: /front_end/jfrontend/app/
// - ai-agents/ (existing)
// - api/ (existing API routes)
// - components/ (reusable components)
```

**C. API Integration Pattern**
```typescript
// Research: How to call the new FastAPI endpoints?
// Current pattern analysis needed:
// - How does the frontend currently call python_back_end?
// - What's the authentication flow?
// - How are responses handled and displayed?

// Potential API hooks:
const useWorkflowSearch = () => {
  // Search workflows by semantic query
}

const useWorkflowSimilarity = () => {
  // Find similar workflows
}

const useWorkflowStats = () => {
  // Get embedding statistics
}
```

### 4. Architecture Integration Research üèóÔ∏è

#### Current System Analysis Needed

**A. Existing Backend Architecture**
```bash
# Research current python_back_end structure:
ls -la python_back_end/
# Questions:
# - How are current AI endpoints structured?
# - What's the authentication mechanism?
# - How does it connect to the existing database?
# - What's the Docker network configuration?
```

**B. Database Architecture**
```sql
-- Research: How does the embedding table relate to existing tables?
-- Current database schema analysis needed:
\dt  -- List all tables
-- Questions:
# - Are there existing workflow or user tables?
# - How to relate embeddings to user accounts?
# - What's the data retention policy?
```

**C. Docker Network Integration**
```yaml
# Research: How to integrate embedding service with existing services?
# Current docker-compose.yml analysis needed:
# - What networks are used?
# - How do services communicate?
# - Where does the embedding service fit?

# Questions:
# - Should embedding be a separate microservice?
# - Or integrated into the existing python_back_end?
# - How to handle scaling and performance?
```
