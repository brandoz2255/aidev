You are a senior platform engineer (Docker + FastAPI + Next.js + websockets/xterm.js). I need you to produce minimal code diffs to fix my session startup and file explorer issues in ‚ÄúVibe Coding‚Äù.

Symptoms (real logs)
ERROR:vibecoding.containers:Failed to create dev container: 404 Client Error for http+docker://localhost/v1.51/images/create?tag=latest&fromImage=vibecoading-optimized: Not Found ("pull access denied for vibecoading-optimized, repository does not exist or may require 'docker login'")

What‚Äôs wrong

Bad image name (typo: vibecoading-optimized vs vibecoding-optimized) ‚Üí image pull 404 ‚Üí container never created.

UI calls /files/* before the container/session is ready ‚Üí 404 flood.

Backend returns HTML/text on errors; frontend blindly JSON.parse ‚Üí parse exceptions spam.

What I want from you

Produce unified diffs and small snippets to implement all of the following (assume Python/FastAPI backend and Next.js App Router frontend):

A) Image resolution & config

Introduce VIBECODING_IMAGE env (default: vibecoding-optimized:latest).

Add ensure_image(client) that get()s, then pull()s if missing; raise a clear error if the repo truly doesn‚Äôt exist.

Replace any hardcoded/typo‚Äôd image names with this config.

B) Container creation with readiness

In vibecoding.containers create path:

Create/attach the session volume.

Create the container with tty, stdin_open, --init, mount /workspace.

Command should touch a readiness file and then idle, e.g. bash -lc 'test -d /workspace && touch /tmp/ready && sleep infinity'.

After start(), poll exec_run("test -f /tmp/ready && echo READY || echo WAIT") for up to ~5s, then mark session ready=true.

C) Always-JSON error responses

Add FastAPI exception handlers so any backend error becomes JSON:

{"ok": false, "error": "‚Ä¶", "code": "IMAGE_UNAVAILABLE" | "INTERNAL"} with appropriate status code.

Make /api/vibecoding/session/status?id=‚Ä¶ always return JSON: {"ok": true, "ready": bool, "sessionId": "‚Ä¶"}.

D) Frontend gating + safe JSON

Add a safeJson(res) helper that checks Content-Type and throws a friendly error if non-JSON or ok:false.

Implement waitReady(sessionId, timeoutMs=15000) polling /session/status until ready:true.

Gate the file explorer + terminal: do not call /api/vibecoding/files until waitReady resolves.

On error, surface the JSON message instead of crashing on JSON.parse.

E) Optional quick ops note

Include a short note/commands to docker build -t vibecoding-optimized:latest . or docker pull <registry>/vibecoding-optimized:latest so hosts are warm.

Please deliver

Unified diffs for these files (adjust names if mine differ):

backend/vibecoding/config.py (new VIBECODING_IMAGE, ensure_image).

backend/vibecoding/containers.py (use ensure_image, create/start container, readiness wait).

backend/app.py or backend/routes/vibecoding.py (JSON exception handlers, /session/status).

frontend/app/vibecode/page.tsx and/or frontend/components/VibeSessionManager.tsx (add safeJson, waitReady, gate calls to /files).

If needed: frontend/lib/api.ts (shared fetch wrapper).

Show code for:

safeJson (checks content-type, parses text, handles ok:false).

waitReady polling loop (250ms interval, timeout handling).

A brief verification checklist:

With bad image name ‚Üí client shows JSON error IMAGE_UNAVAILABLE (no parse error).

With correct image present ‚Üí session becomes ready:true within ~1‚Äì2s, no 404s, file tree loads.

A concise commit message I can use.

Constraints

Keep changes minimal and production-safe.

Put code first (diffs/snippets), then a short explanation.

If you need to infer file paths, use placeholders but be consistent.

Goal: No more 404/parse spam. If the image is wrong, the UI shows a clean JSON error. With a correct image, container creation + readiness is fast, and the explorer/terminal only start once ready:true.

try to refrain from removing code more than adding code
