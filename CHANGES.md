# Summary of Changes

This file documents the key improvements and additions made to the project.

## Vibe Coding Feature

1.  **VibeAgent Implementation:**
    -   Introduced `VibeAgent` in `python_back_end/ollama_cli/vibe_agent.py` to manage AI-powered coding workflows.
    -   Enabled plan generation from high-level objectives using Ollama LLM.
    -   Implemented a robust user confirmation mechanism for sensitive actions.
    -   **Enhanced File Operations:** Modified LLM prompt to encourage use of `create_file` and `write_to_file` for safer file manipulation.
    -   **Autonomous Error Diagnosis:** Implemented logic to capture `stderr` from command execution, prompt LLM for diagnosis, and suggest fixes.
    -   **Completed Assistant Mode:** `execute_assistant_command` now fully executes and streams command output, including error diagnosis.
2.  **FastAPI Integration:**
    -   Added `/api/ws/vibe` WebSocket endpoint to `python_back_end/main.py` for real-time communication with the `VibeAgent`.
    -   Integrated `VibeAgent` instance into the main FastAPI application.

## Code Improvements

1. **CUDA Error Handling**:
   - Added robust error handling for CUDA operations in TTS
   - Implemented retry mechanisms with fallback to CPU when necessary
   - Added dynamic VRAM threshold based on available GPU memory
   - Improved logging for better debugging and troubleshooting

2. **Docker Security**:
   - Updated Dockerfile to run the application as a non-root user
   - Created system group and user `app` for improved security

## Documentation

1. **README.md**:
   - Added detailed project description, features, and requirements
   - Provided comprehensive installation instructions (local and Docker)
   - Documented all Docker Compose services including the new agent-zero-run microservice
   - Added information about VRAM management and CUDA handling
   - Included troubleshooting steps for common issues

2. **CHANGES.md**:
   - Created this file to document key improvements and additions

## Docker Configuration

1. **docker-compose.yaml**:
   - Added the `agent-zero-run` microservice connected to Ollama
   - Updated documentation in README.md to reflect the new service

## Next Steps

1. Test the application thoroughly, especially the CUDA error handling and fallback mechanisms
2. Review all logging output for completeness and usefulness
3. Consider adding more detailed error messages or status indicators in the web UI
